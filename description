Code Explanation:
This Arduino code reads the sound level from a sound sensor connected to an analog input pin and uses this value to control ten LEDs connected to digital pins. The LEDs light up progressively based on the sound intensity, creating a visual representation of the sound level.

Components and Connections:
>Sound Sensor: Connected to analog pin A0.
>LEDs: Connected to digital pins 2 through 11.
Detailed Breakdown:
>Constants and Variables:
const int soundSensorPin = A0;: Defines the analog pin connected to the sound sensor.
const int ledPins[] = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11};: Defines an array of digital pins connected to the LEDs.
>setup() Function:
pinMode(soundSensorPin, INPUT);: Sets the sound sensor pin as an input.
A for loop sets each LED pin as an output.
Serial.begin(9600);: Initializes serial communication for debugging purposes.
>loop() Function:
int soundValue = analogRead(soundSensorPin);: Reads the analog input value from the sound sensor.
A for loop iterates through the 10 LED pins:
It calculates the lower and upper bounds for the current sound level range.
If the sound value falls within this range, a nested loop turns on the LEDs up to the current index and turns off the remaining LEDs.
This creates a bar-graph-like display where more LEDs light up as the sound level increases.


How It Works:
Reading Sound Levels: The sound sensor continuously measures the ambient sound level and converts it into an analog value ranging from 0 to 1023.
Mapping Sound Levels to LEDs:
The code divides the range of possible sound values into ten segments.
Each segment corresponds to a specific range of sound levels.
When the sound level falls within a particular range, the LEDs up to that segment's index are lit.
This visually represents the sound intensity, with more LEDs lit for higher sound levels.
Example
If the sound value read is 250, it falls into the second segment (70-170), so the first two LEDs will be lit.
If the sound value read is 800, it falls into the eighth segment (770-870), so the first eight LEDs will be lit, and the remaining two will be off.
This code provides a simple and effective way to visualize sound levels in real-time using an array of LEDs.
